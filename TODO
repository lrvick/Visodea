//////// TO DO ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


- Move "first name" and "last name" fields to profile instead of account. Account settings should be related to username/password only.
- Pages module - "Template" field - Instead of regular text input, change to select box of available template files.
- Merge "add users to project" form into "manage user" form.  Goal here is to have manage user form to be the one-stop-shop for project user management (add, edit, delete)
- User to user messaging and notifications
- Project RSS feeds
- Project ratings (review with adam and mat)
- Permissions framework (review with adam and mat)
- List projects you have been added to along with the projects you own.
- Email users when they are added to projects (notifications)
- Project access request
- Search auto-complete
