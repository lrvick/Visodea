This is a django project aimed to be a full portal for people with ideas to pitch them to others to reach investment goals. 

Similar to Kickstarter but has a whole system of privacy rules so people can control more sensitive projects. 

Aimed to be a general purpouse tool for people with good ideas, to document them and, seek angel investment. Kind of like a dating site only instead of men-seeking-women it was more of investors-seeing-projects and projects-seeking-investors. 

Project never really got traction and is here for mostly reference purpouses.

It was working at one point, but would need a good beating to be made to work with a modern version of django

If anyone decides they want to give any of this code some love, I would be more than happy to help. Hit me up on irc://irc.udderweb.com/#uw

I may clean up some of these apps and roll them into their own repositories at some point as I have use of them.

One of my first real user-facing django applications. 

Huge thanks to @tsoporan for his help and patience to teach me new things through the course of this project.
