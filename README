This project never really got traction and is here for mostly reference purpouses.

If anyone decideds they are passionate about this and want to give it some love, I would be more than happy to point you in the right direction.

I may clean up soem of these apps and roll them into their own repositories at some point as I have use of them.

One of my firs real user-facing django applications. 

Huge thanks to @tsoporan for his help and patience to teach me new things through the course of this project.
